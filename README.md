# Hi, I am a Year 4 Business Analytics student at NUS Computing. I have had 1 year of Data Engineering Experience at NUS Overseas College Silicon Valley, Smule. I handled production issues and worked with systems such as VerticaDB, Airflow, Hadoop. I am also familiar with linux administration and bash scripting. I like databases as well and learnt how to optimize SQL queries. 

# I would love to get to know more about Data Engineering @ Govtech!
